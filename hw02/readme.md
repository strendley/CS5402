# Homework 02 

Get the blockbuster-top_ten_movies_per_year_DFE.csv data file from Canvas. 
 
Look at the attributes in each instance and document the different properties of the attributes.  Is the attribute a Nominal, Ordinal, Interval or Ratio measure. If the attribute is a Nominal or Ordinal measure, use a histogram or bar chart to show the different values, unless each instance has a unique value then you can just state it as such.  If the attribute is an Interval measure, then you should also note the ordering of the labels.  If the attribute is a Ratio measure, then you should note the significance of the zero value. 
 
Also note any other significant features of the data, such as if the data is sparse or not, or if there are any missing data values.
