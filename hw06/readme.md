# HOMEWORK 06 

## Assignment: 
You are the new junior member of a data mining consulting firm.  An old client has returned. You have worked with the client previously to help them classify a large number of unknown animals.  If you recall they were very happy with your previous work, classifying their unknown animals as mammal and non-mammal. Since that project, they returned to get more granular classification of the unknown animals.  You built a classification system to help their field agents classify these new animals as amphibian, arthropod, bird, fish, insect, mammal, or reptile from the observational data they have collected. 
 
They ended up not being satisfied with the results of the second model and want to take a new approach.  Something a little less terrestrial. They want you to build a system that will cluster the unknown animals into categories based on the already recorded attributes. 
 
Follow the corporate report template to format your work. 
 
## The Details: 
 
Use the data to create a clustering system that is designed to cluster animals based on their attributes. 
 
In the example description section describe the attributes that have been provided and any attributes that need to be generated.  Include whether the attribute is nominal, ordianal, interval, or ratio.  Document the process used to generate the generated attributes. 
 
In the data import and wrangling section import the data and convert any nominal or ordinal values into numeric values.  Also determine if there are any redundant attributes that may be considered for removal. 
 
In the mining and analytics section you will need to determine your own number of clusters. This means you may need to run a clustering model multiple times or use a schema-independent technique to determine an appropriate number of clusters. Use multiple clustering techniques and determine which one you like the best. 
 
In the evaluation section you will need to support why you went with a particular clustering technique. 
 
In the results section clearly declare and explain the clusters that your model created. 
 
In the reference section document any references you needed.  
 
Use visualizations where appropriate. 
 
The following is the only metadata about the attributes in the data set..
