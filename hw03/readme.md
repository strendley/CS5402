# Homework 03 

## Assignment: 

You are the new junior member of a data mining consulting firm.  Your newest client has uncovered a large number of unknown animals and has asked you to build a classification system to help their field agents classify these new animals as mammal or non-mammal from the observational data they have collected.  
 
The client feels their field agents can reliably collect the following observational data: presence of hair, presence of  feathers, if they lay eggs, if they nurse their young with milk, if they are airborne, if they are aquatic, if they are predatory, if they have teeth, if they have a backbone, if they breath air, if they are venomous, if they have fins, the number of legs they have, if they have a tail, if they are domesticated, if they are cat sized, and approximate gestation period. 
 
Your client, audience, can have technical skills that range from introductory (the field agents) to highly skilled (the clients in house scientists).  Keep this in mind when determining what to document and whether to use visualizations or not. 
 
The client has provided a training data set and a test data set of known animals to train your classification system with.  The tranimal-taxonomy-train.csv and the test data set animal-taxonomy-test.csv can be found in Canvas, the company document management system. 
 
Follow the corporate report template to format your work. 
 
## The Details: 
 
Use the data to create a 1R classifier to classify input data as mammal or non-mammal. 
 
In the example description section describe the attributes that have been provided and any attributes that need to be generated.  Include whether the attribute is nominal, ordianal, interval, or ratio.  Document the process used to generate the generated attributes. 
 
In the data import and wrangling section import the data and discretize any interval or ratio attributes. Also in the data import and wrangling section, create a two class classification with the class mammal and non-mammal. 
 
In the mining and analytics section use the training data set to manually create a 1R classifier to classify each example as mammal or non-mammal. Manually means you can use code to build a frequency table of the classes of each attribute and/or a table of probabilities.  It also means 
you will use the tables to determine the classification rule.  When manually generating the classifier I donâ€™t want you to use a one package does it all method.  I want you to look at the tables and determine your own classification rule. 
 
Then use the training data set to create a 1R classifier to classify mammal and non-mammal using the RStudio package oneR. 
 
In the evaluation section use the test data set to create a confusion matrix for the manually created 1R classifier and for the program generate 1R classifier. Then determine the Accuracy and F1-Score for each model.  Show any intermediate calculations.  Use the Accuracy and F1-Score to evaluate which classifier is better. 
 
In the results section clearly declare the 1R rule you have decided on. 
 
In the reference section document any references you needed.  
 
Use visualizations where appropriate. 
 
The following is the only metadata about the attributes in the data set..
